# Welcome To My Site

This site was generated with [mkdocs.org](https://www.mkdocs.org). This site is a proof of concept for a class I will be teaching in the future, and I wanted to use something I was familiar with. I will project just store my resume and some other things I find interesting here.

## Project layout

    mkdocs.yml    # The configuration file.
    docs/
        index.md  # The documentation homepage.
        ...       # Other markdown pages, images and other files.
